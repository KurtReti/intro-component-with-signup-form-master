## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"[Field Name] cannot be empty"*
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Looks like this is not an email"*

## My process

- Establish the basic layout with html boxes, using borders to see the layout before adding
the text content.
- Moving on to the CSS to add the proper styling and breakpoint for responsive design.
- Finished the challenge with basic javascript functions to validate textbox inputs, changing the styling when they were empty and revealing paragraph elements below.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Boxes and Breakpoints
- Mobile-first workflow

### Continued development

Having trouble keeping the content in the center of the page when the window is resized, had a similiar problem in my last challenge that I resolved but 
I was unable to apply the same fix here.
